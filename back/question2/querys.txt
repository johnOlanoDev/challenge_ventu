1. Write a query to print the id, first_name and last_name. To filter the names, concatenate the first and last names to create a combined name.
SELECT CONCAT(CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, " ", CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME) AS NAMES_COMMBINATION FROM customer

2. Return the names of customers whose combined names are less than 12 letters long.
SELECT CONCAT(CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, " ", CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME) AS NAMES_COMMBINATION FROM customer
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(CONCAT(CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, " ", CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME)) < 12

3. Sort the results by their combined name lengths
SELECT CONCAT(CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, " ", CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME) AS NAMES_COMMBINATION FROM customer
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(CONCAT(CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, " ", CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME))
ORDER BY CHAR_LENGTH(CONCAT(CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, " ", CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME));

4. then alphabetically, case insensitive, by combined name
SELECT CONCAT(CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, " ", CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME) AS NAMES_COMPLETE FROM customer
ORDER BY CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME ASC;

5. then by id. All
SELECT CONCAT(CUSTOMER.FIRST_NAME, " ", CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME) AS NAMES_COMPLETE FROM customer
ORDER BY ID ASC;
